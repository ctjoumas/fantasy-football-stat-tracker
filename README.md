# fantasy-football-stat-tracker

Displays live game stats for players, displaying them in a head to head matchup. All player information is pulled back from the Yahoo Sports API (https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/). However, since this API doesn't provide live stats, the fantasy points scored by a player are retrieved by scraping the HTML at ESPN's gametracker and play-by-play pages.
